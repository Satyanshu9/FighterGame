# FighterGame
I've made this street fighter game during my technical training - Python in IOT by BrainMentors. 
Okay so this was really fun. I came to know about many new concepts making this game such as
about the OOPs, SpriteSheets, Animations, Pygame , etc
I've various other projects on IOT and Automation which I'm looking forward to upload in my repo.
